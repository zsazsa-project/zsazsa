/**
 * hljs-toml.js — highlight.js language definition for TOML (Elastic
 * Security detection rules).
 *
 * Ported from the Rulezet project (github.com/ngsoti/rulezet-core,
 * AGPL-3.0), so a rule looks the same in zsazsa's rule viewer as on Rulezet.
 * highlight.js ships no official grammar for it, so it is registered at
 * runtime with hljs.registerLanguage() by rulezet-code-modal.js, which loads
 * this file with a dynamic import() the first time a rule is shown.
 *
 * The highlight.js common build zsazsa loads from cdnjs has no real TOML
 * grammar: it aliases "toml" to its INI mode, which knows nothing of
 * triple-quoted strings. rulezet-code-modal.js registers this one under
 * "toml" explicitly so it takes precedence over that alias.
